      <description>We organized a month-long stability study to observe over 40 different drug analytes of relevance and their associated stability in different temperature conditions.
The stability study is now used internally at Aegis Sciences to validate oral fluid forensic processes, and was designed as a benchmark the stability of drug analytes in the oral fluid matrix. One can find the associated presentation here, which I gave at the 2017 SERMACS conference in Charlotte, NC.</description>
